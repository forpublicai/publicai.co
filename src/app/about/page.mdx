The Public AI Inference Utility is a nonprofit, open-source project. Our team builds products and organizes advocacy to support the work of public AI model builders like the Swiss AI Initiative, AI Singapore, AI Sweden, and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center.

We believe in public AIâ€”AI as public infrastructure like highways, water, or electricity. Think of a BBC for AI, a public utility for AI, or public libraries for AI.

Our team is fiscally sponsored by [Metagov](https://metagov.org) and funded by Mozilla, the Future of Life Institute, and the Center for Cultural Innovation.

We are part of the global movement for public AI. Take a look at our sister project, the [Public AI Network](https://publicai.network), or sign up for our [newsletter](https://publicai.substack.com).
