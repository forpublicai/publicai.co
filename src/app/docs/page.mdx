## Understanding Model Providers

Public AI aggregates models from multiple providers to offer you the best available options. When you select a model, you're choosing from our curated list of high-quality AI systems.

We prioritize open-source and transparent models where possible, but also include proprietary models when they offer significant value to users.

## Current Model Providers

Our platform currently includes models from:

- Anthropic (Claude models)

- Other open-source providers

This list is regularly updated as new models become available and existing ones are improved.

## How to See Which Model You're Using

The currently selected model is displayed at the top of the chat interface. You can:

- Click the model name to see details
- Switch between available models

## Provider Transparency

We believe in transparency about which models and providers you're using. Each model listing includes:

- Provider name and information

## Data Details

## Privacy and Data Flow

When you use Public AI's inference utility, your conversations may be processed by different AI providers depending on which model you select. Here's how your data flows:

- You send a message through our interface
- We route it to the appropriate model provider
- The provider processes your request and returns a response
- We display the response to you

Your conversations are temporarily stored to enable features like conversation history, but we do not permanently retain personal data unless explicitly agreed to.

## The Public AI Data Flywheel
