Through this collaboration, users can now access and test public and sovereign AI models like Switzerland's [Apertus](https://huggingface.co/swiss-ai/Apertus-8B-Instruct-2509?inference_provider=publicai) and Singapore's [SEA-LION](https://huggingface.co/aisingapore/Gemma-SEA-LION-v4-27B-IT?inference_provider=publicai) directly through the developer-friendly Hugging Face ecosystem. This is an important step for making public AI more accessible to developers, researchers, and organizations worldwide.

The entire process was surprisingly easy; we just made a few PRs directly to the HF site. Also hat tip to [Poli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/apolinariosteps/) (not pictured) who made the connection.
